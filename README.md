# Number Guessing Game

This is a Rust command-line program where you guess a sequence of random numbers.

## How it works

- You choose how many numbers you'd like to guess.
- For each number, try to guess the randomly chosen value between 1 and 10.
- The game tells you if your guess is too big, too small, or correct.

## Running the program

Make sure you have Rust installed. Then:

```
cargo run
```

Follow the prompts to play the game.
